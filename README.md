## Summary: 3DCOM Collatz Recursion and Emergent Physics

- The work explores a mathematical framework using **recursive Collatz sequences** and **octave reduction** (modular mapping) to simulate how reality emerges from fundamental oscillations.
- The model generates Collatz sequences in 3D layers, mapping each number into a cyclic/octave structure to represent recursive resonance.
- A **recursive wave equation** is used whose iterations quickly stabilize at a value called the **LZ constant ($1.23498228$)**; this is interpreted as a universal attractor or threshold—a mathematical signature of stabilization, akin to physical ground states or limit cycles.
- The chain of emergence posited is:
    - **Wave (oscillation)** → **Sound (resonance/tension)** → **Photon (quantized light)** → **Plasma (collective mode, unclosed loop)** → **Matter (stable resonance)**.
- In simulation, discrete recursive values create sound frequencies; as "tension" builds, photon emission efficiency rises—reaching nearly perfect conversion at the LZ constant, which is modeled as the genesis of photons from wave resonance.
- Experimental protocol involves exciting resonance (ultrasound), monitoring photon creation, and analyzing if photon yield increases as predicted—mirroring ideas in nonlinear quantum optics and sound-induced emission.
- This theory is an alternative to space/time or vacuum-based quantum models, proposing that reality emerges from recursive wave patterns and attractor states rather than a pre-existing spacetime background.
- The LZ constant is hypothesized as a cross-domain bridge, with applications from atomic to cosmic scales—a universal stabilization point that can be tested against real physical systems.
